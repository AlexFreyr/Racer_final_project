# Racer

## About
This is our final project for this school semester.
This project will be a racer game mainly focused in keeping score and displaying it to other users who might be playing as well.
The language we will focus on for the project is Python for the actual game it self and a simple website that keeps track of the user scores, using HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP

## How to play the game
1. Download the game from github
2. Go to the [racer sign up page](http://vorur.info/login.php). And sign up for a new account
3. Launch game from where you downloaded it
4. Sign in
5. Now you're playing!

## Core of the game
The main focus on this project is that the users will be able to see each other scores and see how other people are doing compared to them.

## Goals that we hope to acomplish
1. Making your car customizable, so that you can be unique from everyone else.
2. Races can take place online, so that you can see everyone play whilst you race around. (We're not sure how to pull this one off though)

*More will be added if we find something that we might find interessing.*
